    <h2>Understanding River Rapids</h2>
    <p>
      Rapids are fast-moving sections of the river where water flows quickly over rocks.
      They are exciting, challenging, and one of the main reasons people love white water rafting.
    </p>

    <h3>Rapids Difficulty Levels</h3>
    <p>
      Rapids are grouped into levels called “classes.”
      Class I is easy with small waves, and Class V is extremely difficult and only for experts.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Rapids Matter</h3>
    <p>
      Rapids make each rafting trip unique. They are shaped by water speed, drops, and the shape of the river.
      No two rapids are exactly the same.
